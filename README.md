COVID-19 has no doubt changed what we consider "normal" and that includes biking! After many months of lockdown, New York eased restrictions and entered phase four in late July to included low risk outdoor activity (https://www1.nyc.gov/nycbusiness/article/reopening-guide#phasefour). 
For that reason, I decided to analyze the dataset for July 2020 to determine if there was a significant peak upon entering phase four (July 20) and if the demographics of Citibike users might reflect the current pandemic conditions. 

Interestingly enough, the map plot showed very little active stations in New York City. Almost all of the stations were in Jersey City, which also has a younger median population (less than 40) compared to New York’s older population. 
This is not surprising considering that COVID-19 poses a higher risk to older individuals. As expected, the most popular day by user type line chart showcases higher user counts towards the end of the month post the phase four date. 
However, there were notable spikes in customers on the weekends whereas subscribers accounted for the majority of users during the weekday. Citibike currently offers a 24 hour or 3 day pass to non-subscribers, but a permanent “weekend-only” subscription plan might attract more users consistently and take advantage of those who are more inclined to partake in outdoor activities after a strenuous work week. 

Analyzing the demographics of the users, there is an obvious peak in customers age at 1969. Some applications set a default year, and perhaps this is the case with Citibike. It skews available data and is in line with increased privacy concerns about data collection for marketing purposes.
Despite the data bias, there were some valuable takeaways. Younger users are less likely to commit to a subscription plan and prefer to stick with short term passes. This supports the idea to offer cheaper, part-time subscription plans.  

Also of interest is that females take longer trips on average than males until around the age of 60.
